# Overview

This is a simple game prototype which relies on its unique movement design. Essentially, you're fighting and moving in 0 gravity
without any kind of thrusters or boosters. You need to leverage exisitng means of thrust or use walls.

I designed this to test a proof of concept for a larger project that I'm working on. The original inspiration is in 2D, but I'm
designing this in "3D" so that you can switch from top-down to isometric perspectives which will be useful for my bigger game.

# Development Environment

This project was written using the Godot engine.  

As such, I used the propritary editor and prototyped using GDScript to manage my nodes.
